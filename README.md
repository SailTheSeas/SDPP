#Where to Navigate Scripts
The two files are the containers of all the scripts made:
*myphp
*MyUnityScripts 

#What is Within Those Scripts
Within the my php folder, the 3 files update.php, signup.php, and login.php are the only files needed to work with the database.
Within MyUnityScripts, the class files Sign Up and Log In allow for users to perform those actions. Records Link publishes changes to the database.
The static class DB Controller stores user records and a user log in status.
The class Input Validation checks and validates user input. 


#Setting Up PHP Server
The server was set up utilising LAMPP. 
You will thus need to install :
*PHP from php.net to run php, as well as any text editor
*To install Apache2, and MySQL
*To install LAMPP
